Explanation

The number of times ‘hello’ is printed is equal to the number of processes created. 
Total Number of Processes = 2n, where n is the number of fork system calls. 
So here n = 3, 23 = 8 Let us put some label names for the three lines:

fork ();   // Line 1
fork ();   // Line 2
fork ();   // Line 3

       L1       // There will be 1 child process 
    /     \     // created by line 1.
  L2      L2    // There will be 2 child processes
 /  \    /  \   //  created by line 2
L3  L3  L3  L3  // There will be 4 child processes 
                // created by line 3
                
So there is a total of eight processes (new child processes and one original process). 
If we want to represent the relationship between the processes as a tree hierarchy it 
would be the following: The main process: P0 Processes created by the 1st fork: P1 Processes 
created by the 2nd fork: P2, P3 Processes created by the 3rd fork: P4, P5, P6, P7

             P0
         /   |   \
       P1    P4   P2
      /  \          \
    P3    P6         P5
   /
 P7
