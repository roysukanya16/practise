shmget(): int shmget(key_t,size_tsize,intshmflg); upon successful completion, shmget() returns an
         identifier for the shared memory segment.
         #include <sys/ipc.h>
        #include <sys/shm.h>

shmat():
    Before you can use a shared memory segment, you have to attach yourself
    to it using shmat(). void *shmat(int shmid ,void *shmaddr ,int shmflg);
    shmid is shared memory id. shmaddr specifies specific address to use but we should set
    it to zero and OS will automatically choose the address.
      #include <sys/shm.h>
        #include <sys/types.h>

IPC_CREAT|0666:
    0666 is the usual access permision in linux in rwx octal format and having the sequence(owner-group-user). IPC_CREAT has the value of 512 in decimal as defined in the sys/ipc.h header file.

    IPC_CREAT|0666 basically performs bitwise or of the two to set the flag in shmget, and both of them 
    simply perform their usual functions. 0666 sets the access permissions of the memory segment while
    IPC_CREAT tells the system to create a new memory segment
    for the shared memory.
